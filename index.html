    <h2>About Us</h2>

                <h3>Scientific Land-Use & Management Planning</h3>
                <p>
                  We transform your farm into a blueprint for success.
                  Using drone mapping, soil analysis, and spatial planning,
                  our team develops comprehensive land-use plans that maximize every hectare’s potential.<br>
                  From field layout and irrigation design to crop zoning and infrastructure placement,
                  every decision is guided by science — ensuring higher yields, lower waste, and sustainable land stewardship.

                <h3>Drone-Based Underground Water Surveys</h3>
                <p>
                  Eliminate the guesswork and find water with precision.
                  Our drone-powered geophysical surveys use advanced sensors
                  to detect underground water sources and aquifer patterns before drilling begins.
                  This technology minimizes costly trial-and-error drilling, providing reliable
                  data that ensures your investment in boreholes and irrigation systems is well-informed and efficient.
